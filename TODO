  Caching features and point matches in the file system uses the project
  specific id of a patch as a unique identifier for a patch.  This will fail
  if several independent projects share the same directory in the file system.
  I have seen this happening in Janelia Farm for several dozens of projects.
  What about using a hash-code (md5?) of the absolute path to an image instead?

  Invalidate cached PointMatches when updating the mipmaps in the same way as
  cached feature extractions.
