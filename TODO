  Caching features and point matches in the file system uses the project
  specific id of a patch as a unique identifier for a patch.  This will fail
  if several independent projects share the same directory in the file system.
  I have seen this happening in Janelia Farm for several dozens of projects.
  What about using a hash-code (md5?) of the absolute path to an image instead?

  Patches use the min and max values in several wrong ways.  RGB patches create
  wrong output from the very beginning, grey images create the wrong output if
  a CoordinateTransform is available.

  Changing the properties of a CoordinateTransform attached to a patch leads to
  wrong bounding boxes.
