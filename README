To compile the source you need:
- A java system compliant with Java 1.5.0 (Sun Microsystems), but 1.6.0 is STRONGLY recommended.
- ImageJ 1.37g or higher from http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/upgrade/
- The PostgreSQL JDBC driver, from http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-8.1-405.jdbc3.jar
- A number of jars (precompiled for java 1.6.0):
	http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/jars/edu_mines_jtk.jar
	http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/jars/ImageJ_3D_Viewer.jar
	http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/jars/AmiraMesh_.jar
	http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/jars/jzlib-1.0.7.jar
	http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/jars/Jama-1.0.2.jar

You can get the latest source code from the git repository at:
	http://repo.or.cz/w/trakem2.git

It is strongly recommended to use Java 1.6.0 whenever possible, since repainting speed is much higher.

To compile, use a script similar to:

	$ javac -classpath ij.jar:$(find . -name "*.jar" -printf "%h/%f:"):. $(find . -name "*.java" -printf "%h/%f ")

You can then create a jar file using:

	$ jar cf TrakEM2_.jar plugins.config $(find . -name "*.class" -printf "%h/%f ")



which can be placed in the ImageJ plugins folder and will appear as a menu:
Plugins

A postgresql database is OPTIONAL: as of version 0.3g, XML / file system -based projects are also available.

In an XML project, images exist in your folders wherever you choose, and then the entire project details (segmentations, labels, transformations of the images, etc) live in a single .xml file.

For database projects, a PostgreSQL database (7.4.* or 8.1.3 or above) is required. 
Get PostgreSQL from http://www.postgresql.org
